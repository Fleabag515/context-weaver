# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.
The format is loosely based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and the project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.3.0] — Unreleased

### Fixed
- **Streaming**: SSE responses are now piped through to the client unbuffered.
  Previously every chunk was concatenated before the response head was sent,
  defeating `stream=true` entirely. Streamed assistant turns are now
  reconstructed from delta frames and persisted to memory like non-streamed ones.
- **Foresight extractor** no longer shares the `extracted` flag with the
  memcell extractor. A new `foresight_scanned` column on `turns` means each
  pipeline tracks its own state and can no longer starve the other.
- **Consolidator** uses a self-rescheduling `setTimeout` chain with a
  `_running` guard instead of `setInterval`. Slow Ollama calls can no longer
  cause overlapping consolidation runs on the same session.
- **Auth header**: an empty `upstream.apiKey` now means *passthrough* — the
  client's own `Authorization` header reaches upstream. Previously it was
  silently stripped.
- **Hardcoded paths**: `config.json` ships `~/.anamnesis/history.db` and the
  proxy expands `~`, `$HOME`, `${HOME}` in any string value. `install.sh`
  picks the latest Node from `~/.nvm/versions/node` instead of pinning
  `v22.22.2`.

### Added
- `embedding_model` column on `turns`, `memcells`, and `memscenes`. Selector
  and consolidator skip vectors produced by a different model so similarity
  scores can't be silently meaningless after a model swap.
- `lib/ollama.js`, `lib/heuristics.js`, `lib/logger.js`, `lib/proxy-helpers.js`
  — shared modules consolidating duplicate HTTP/heuristic/log code that had
  drifted across extractor, foresight, embedder, and consolidator.
- `ANAMNESIS_LOG` environment variable (`error|warn|info|debug`) gates
  per-request selector tracing for production deployments.
- `node:test` suite with focused coverage of pure helpers (session keys,
  SSE accumulator, cosine, decay scoring, JSON-from-prose parsing).
- `.editorconfig`, `.prettierrc`, `eslint.config.js`, and a GitHub Actions
  workflow running tests and linting on Node 18/20/22.
- Top-level `LICENSE` (MIT) — the package.json had declared MIT for a while
  but the licence file itself was missing.

### Changed
- `install.sh` writes a unit named `anamnesis.service` (was
  `context-weaver.service`, a leftover from an earlier project).
- Session keys are now `auth:<sha256(token).slice(0,16)>` instead of the
  last 16 bytes of the bearer token verbatim. Same uniqueness guarantee,
  no credential bytes leaked into log lines or `session_key` rows.
- Consolidator now computes `avg_importance` from cluster members instead
  of always storing the default `0.5`.

## [0.2.0]

Initial public release with memcell + memscene + foresight pipeline.
